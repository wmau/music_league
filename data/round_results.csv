BOS BOPS 🎤🎶,8,Chris Podracky,Our Mixtape,Alex Mui,2,"This is so East Coast pop punk circa 2010, in the best way possible. I really like the rest of their music. Reminds me of The Starting Line & early All Time Low"
BOS BOPS 🎤🎶,8,Chris Podracky,Our Mixtape,William Mau,1,I'm normally not an alternative rock guy but surprisingly this song grew on me and this is obscure as obscure can be. How did you even find this?

BOS BOPS 🎤🎶,8,Anna Mai,Magic Shop,William Mau,-1,Anna why
BOS BOPS 🎤🎶,8,Anna Mai,Magic Shop,Jackie Wu,-1,Anna. Truly a worse decision than peach season pizza. Cream cheese sushi still worst tho. 
BOS BOPS 🎤🎶,8,Anna Mai,Magic Shop,Chris Podracky,-1,"This is the best song on here. Without looking at play count I wouldn’t have downvoted because I agree it’s underrated. >300M plays is wild tho. This would be EXO or Red Velvet’s second biggest hit. It would be the most played song for Aespa, MAMAMOO, 2NE1, Super Junior, BIGBANG, or Girl’s Generation. It’s a small slice of the BTS pie, but that pie is so colossal that the slice winds up being more than I can eat. "

BOS BOPS 🎤🎶,11,Michelle Wang,Closer,Alex Mui,0,"I don't care what you (Mau) say. This might be generic with questionable vocals (it's edm-pop), and it may be more than a coincidence that Trump got elected the same year this dropped, but Closer is catchy AF. Who else united the whole world in singing about a stolen mattress and launched Boulder AND Tuscon into the global consciousness? That's Blink-182 levels of iconic. This is the song of a generation. I will defend The Chainsmokers til the day I die.

Anyway, 0 points, no location in title."
